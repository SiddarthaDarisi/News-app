The NewsApp we developed is a custom-tailored news feed application that aims to provide users with the latest news articles in their preferred categories. Built using React and Material UI for the frontend, the app offers a seamless and visually appealing user experience. For the backend, the application leverages DynamoDB as its database, GraphQL for efficient data querying, and AWS Lambda with Amplify for serverless functions. The app is designed with an intelligent feed algorithm that displays general category news when no user is signed in, and adapts the feed based on user preferences upon successful sign-in. In addition to the dynamic news feed, the app is equipped with a user-friendly sign-up and sign-in page, enabling new users to easily join the platform and existing users to access their personalized feeds. A dedicated settings page allows users to customize their news preferences by choosing from various categories, while the built-in search functionality enables them to explore specific topics of interest.
